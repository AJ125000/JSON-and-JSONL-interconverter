# JSON-to-JSONL-converter
* This json_and_jsonline_interconverter.py file contains a very simple code to convert json to jsonline format and vice-versa. Run this file and give the required file paths to obtain the results.
* Also, alternatively, the easier option is to use the streamlit app deployed using json_and_jsonlines_interconverter_app.py.
